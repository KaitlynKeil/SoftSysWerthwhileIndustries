/* Example code for Exercises in C.

This program shows a way to represent a BigInt type (arbitrary length integers)
using C strings, with numbers represents as a string of decimal digits in reverse order.

Follow these steps to get this program working:

1) Read through the whole program so you understand the design.

2) Compile and run the program.  It should run three tests, and they should fail.

3) Fill in the body of reverse_string().  When you get it working, the first test should pass.

4) Fill in the body of ctoi().  When you get it working, the second test should pass.

5) Fill in the body of add_digits().  When you get it working, the third test should pass.

6) Uncomment the last test in main.  If your three previous tests pass, this one should, too.
